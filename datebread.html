    <p>Soda bread is normally pitched as being perfect for people who are a bit scared of making bread. It is much more forgiving than traditional yeasted doughs, and comes together in a fraction of the time. But there are other reasons to make it. Quite simply, it is a delicious, homely bread that I think everyone should have in their repertoire. I’ve taken this version over to the sweet side, but it still holds on to the original’s rustic charm. This bread is best served warm, with lots of salted butter and an extra drizzle of honey.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>350g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ tsp mixed spice</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>50g cold unsalted butter, cubed, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>150g stoned dates, finely chopped</li>
        <li>75g dark chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>200ml buttermilk</li>
        <li>60g honey, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.</li>
        <li>Put the flour, bicarb, cinnamon, mixed spice and salt in a large bowl, add all the cubed butter and rub it in with your fingertips, until the mix resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add the chopped dates and chocolate, then toss to coat.</li>
        <li>In a jug, mix the buttermilk, honey and egg, then pour this into the dry ingredients and use a table knife to combine and bring it all together into a dough. Turn out the dough on to a well-floured surface, give it just a few quick, light kneads, then transfer to the lined tray and use a sharp knife to cut a deep cross intothe top of it.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes, until the loaf is well browned and sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Leave to cool a little before slicing and eating warm with butter and an extra drizzle of honey.</li>
    </ol>
